Count Kmers
Sample windows 
Kmer probability >> kmer weight >> integrated probability score
	Worked example of internal probabilities compensating for sparse 8mer signal
	i.e. (sparse + high information, dense + high noise) = (trade off between sensitivity and specificity) = (True anomalies + missed small features, small feature sensitivity vs high false positive)
Probability of finding in window + Probability of sampling in genome
Sum probability for window (self, genome)
Calculate entropy between local sample and genome probability. [alternate entropy calculations]

Threshold Otsu
Threshold Percentile
Threshold HMM

Segment anomalies using PCA on counts + Clustering
	Where n observations < variables, only able to find up to n eigenvectors.
	Sparse matrix at higher orders
Characterise Intra-cluster driving kmers

Things found (Viruses, TEs, Mitochondrial genes, SM Clusters, RIP Signal)
