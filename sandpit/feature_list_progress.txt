frisk feature list:

[...] Handle numerical scaffold labels
[...] Label threshold vertical line
[...] Give forceThresholdKLD as pre-log10 transformed value
[...] Add option to feed HMM State as Anomaly track to chrm painting

[...] Add Graphic to visualise matrix sparsity (Heatmap grids kmin --> kmax)
	- For whole genome survey (All windows, total counts, mean count over windows, OR props)
	- Note mean number of zeros per window for each order of K
	- make graphic for Cluster groups

[...] two tailed t-test with bonferroni correction for each kmer in anomaly class vs whole genome expected.
[...] Test local enrichment of di/trinucleotide patterns
[...] Custom gff pre-handling option: Strip excess fields, make pandas df --> bed object

[...] Chi-2 or KS test as additional to IMM-KLD (significance of test that samples are from same distribution)
[...] Test effect of rescaling higher order kmer proportions [prop values * (k**4 / 4)]
[...] Gaussian mixed models to find nested distributions / cauchy distributions??

Measure sparsity at each k order, report mean zero value kmers across all surveyed windows:
k=1 	5000/4
k=2 	4999/16
k=3 	4998/64
k=4 	4997/256
k=5 	4996/1024
k=6 	4995/4096  #Getting edgey
k=7 	4994/16384 #Getting sparse out here
k=8 	4993/65536 #Getting sparse out here
